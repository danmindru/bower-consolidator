# Bower consolidator
Takes a bunch of bower packages and finds their version from `bower.json` or `.bower.json`, then makes one big bower file with frozen versions.

### Getting started
```bash
yarn --production
```

## Developing
Start by installing all dependencies.
```bash
yarn # install all dependencies
```

### Testing
```bash
npm test
npm dev # continuous tests, watches files
```
